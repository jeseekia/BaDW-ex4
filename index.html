        <div class="col-md-4" id="box"> <h5>Math is love</h5> 
          <img id="heart_element" src="images/lovemath.jpg" alt="Keep Calm Math"/>
          <p>I absolutely adore mathematics. If I had the Calculus book my dad gave me back when I was 4, that would be the background image for this post. I actually do math for fun and was excited to have to take so much Calculus in order to become an Engineer.</p></div>
        <div class="col-md-4" id="box"><h5>Trust me. I'm an Engineer.</h5> 
          <img id="gear_element" src="images/engineer.jpg" alt=""/>
          <p>I am a full-time student at Wayne State University studying Mechanical Engineering. This was not my original program when I began college, but, somehow I found my way to the COE and I have loved every painful assignment, exam, and occassional repeat of a course.</p></div>
        <div class="col-md-4" id="box"><h5>Coding is fun!</h5> 
          <img id="apple_element" src="images/coding.jpg" alt=""/>
          <p>My first coding class at Wayne State was C++. I spent the entire semester, like everyone else in my class, certain that I was failing epically. I think I got a B+ in the class and gained the courage to take on more languages and projects outside of school. I have no desire to pursue a degree in Computer Science or Computer Engineering though.</p></div>
      </div>

      <div class="row" id="row2">
        <div class="col-md-4" id="box"><h5>"Anthem" by Ayn Rand</h5> 
          <img id="book_element" src="images/anthem.jpg" alt=""/>
          <p>“The word "We" is as lime poured over men, which sets and hardens to stone, and crushes all beneath it, and that which is white and that which is black are lost equally in the grey of it. It is the word by which the depraved steal the virtue of the good, by which the weak steal the might of the strong, by which the fools steal the wisdom of the sages. What is my joy if all hands, even the unclean, can reach into it? What is my wisdom, if even the fools can dictate to me? What is my freedom, if all creatures, even the botched and impotent, are my masters? What is my life, if I am but to bow, to agree and to obey? 

But I am done with this creed of corruption. 

I am done with the monster of "We," the word of serfdom, of plunder, of misery, falsehood and shame. 

And now I see the face of god, and I raise this god over the earth, this god whom men have sought since men came into being, this god who will grant them joy and peace and pride. 

This god, this one word: 

"I.”</p></div>
        <div class="col-md-4" id="box"><h5>Words to live by</h5> 
          <img id="quote_element" src="images/courage.png" alt=""/>
          <p>"Waiting to develop courage is just another form of procrastination. The most successful people take action while they are afraid! This is my guiding light. I am a risk-taker and I have reaped the benefits of taking huge risks. The bigger the risk the bigger the reward as they say. And one thing I know for certain is that by the time you feel "ready" or "prepared" for an opportunity, someone else will already have taken it. I just take a deep breath and do it!</p></div>
        <div class="col-md-4" id="box"><h5>MBTI: INTP</h5>
          <img id="mind_element" src="images/intp.jpg" alt=""/>
          <p>The INTP personality type is fairly rare, making up only three percent of the population, which is definitely a good thing for them, as there's nothing they'd be more unhappy about than being "common". INTPs pride themselves on their inventiveness and creativity, their unique perspective and vigorous intellect. Usually known as the philosopher, the architect, or the dreamy professor, INTPs have been responsible for many scientific discoveries throughout history.</p> <p>Famous INTPs: <br>Socrates;       Rene Descartes;<br>Blaise Pascal;       Isaac Newton;<br>Carl Jung;        Albert Einstein;<br>James Madison;       Dwight D. Eisenhower;<br>Gerald Ford</p></div>

      <div class="row" id="row3">
        <div class="col-md-4" id="box"><h5>It's just hair</h5> 
          <img id="afro_element" src="images/pink.jpg" alt=""/>
          <p>I think it's safe to say that at this point I have had a wide variety of hairstyles in the short 4 weeks that we have been in Build a Dynamic Website, and each one is completely different than the other. About a week and a half ago I decided to shave the sides of my head after getting obsessed with the undercut randomly on a Saturday. I love changing up my style. It's so liberating, but most of all, hair always grows back so I don't feel like it is necessary to hold on to it inevitably.</p></div>
        <div class="col-md-4" id="box"><h5>Anime is an addiction</h5> 
          <img id="naruto_element" src="images/pink.jpg" alt=""/>
          <p>It may be difficult to see, but this graphic is of the Nine Tails Fox Kurama from Naruto. I absolutely love this show and I am very sad to hear that the manga is discontinuing. It took me 2 years to finally watch all of Naruto Shippuden only to get such heartbreaking news. Either way, I can't make a page about my likes without mentioning this.</p></div>
        <div class="col-md-4" id="box"><h5>I get so distracted</h5> 
          <img id="mind_element" src="images/lost.jpg" alt=""/>
          <p>I completely forgot what I was going to put here and this meme immediately came to mind. One terrible thing about having an overactive, analytical mind is that I am easily distracted. :/</p></div>
